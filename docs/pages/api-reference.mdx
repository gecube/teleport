description: The detailed guide to Teleport API

In most cases, you can interact with Teleport using our CLI tools, [tsh](cli-docs.mdx#tsh) and [tctl](cli-docs.mdx#tctl). However, you can also directly access the same gRPC API that `tctl` and `tsh` use.

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.15+ and Setup Go Dev Environment
- Set up Teleport with ([Getting Started Guide](getting-started.mdx))

The easiest way to get started with the Teleport API is to clone the [Go Client Example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/go-client) in our github repo. Follow the README there to quickly authenticate the API with your Teleport Auth Server.

If you want to start from scratch, simply set up a go module and run: 

```bash
$ go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api
```

Then, follow the client documentation below to get the client up and running.

## Documentation

#### GoDoc

The API is documented through [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client) using inline comments and examples. Below are a few noteworthy sections to check out:
 - [Overview](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#pkg-overview)
 - [New Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#New)
 - [Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#Credentials)

There is also some additional information on this page below.
