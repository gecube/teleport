description: The detailed guide to Teleport API
---

In most cases, you can interact with Teleport using our CLI tools, [tsh](cli-docs.mdx#tsh) and [tctl](cli-docs.mdx#tctl). However, you can also directly access the same gRPC API that `tctl` and `tsh` use.

## Documentation

The API is now documented through [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client). 

Here are a few important sections to check out:
 - [Overview README](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#section-readme)
 - [Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#Client)
 - [Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#Credentials)
